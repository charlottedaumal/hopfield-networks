## Report of v7 of the Hopfield Network project

### Aim of the project
The aim of the project is to simulate the evolution of a dynamical system for associative memory, the Hopield Network. It models a simple mechanism to explain how a neural network could store representations in the form of weighted connections between neurons.
Here, we implemented the iterative process which allows to retrieve one of the stored/memorized patterns starting from the representation of a new pattern.
