Project description : 

The aim of this project is to simulate the evolution of biologically-inspired dynamical system, the Hopfield networks. The Hopfield network is a computational model for associative memory, proposed by John Hopfield in 1982. It models a simple mechanism to explain how a neural network could store representations (i.e., the neural activity corresponding to a certain concept) in the form of weighted connections between neurons. 

Here, we will implement the iterative process which allows to retrieve one of the stored (memorized) patterns starting from the representation of a new (unseen) pattern.
