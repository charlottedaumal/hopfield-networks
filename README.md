Project description : 

The aim of this project is to simulate the evolution of biologically-inspired dynamical system, the Hopfield networks.The Hopfield network is a computational model for associative memory, proposed by John Hopfieldin 1982. It models a simple mechanism to explain how a neural network could store representations (i.e., the neural activity corresponding to a certain concept) in the form of weighted connections between neurons. 

Here, we will implement the iterative process which allows to retrieve one of the stored (memorized) patterns starting from the representation of a new (unseen) pattern.


Files : 

1) main.py -> file containing the first version of the code
2) unit_tests_week6 -> file containing the unit tests for the refactoring of the code of week 6
3) function_week6 -> file containing all the functions which are refactoring the code of week 5
4) storkey_rule_week6 -> file containing the function which is applying the storkey rule
